        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Both quick and delicious, this honey chicken is just a darn good recipe to have in the wheelhouse. It's a bit on the simple side, though. Also, it's totally a recipe I <a href="https://youtu.be/3SqoPSO_W9U">stole off of YouTube</a>. So frankly you'd probably be better off looking there. Although this image is in fact my own. At least I can claim to have actually made the dish a few times.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Honestly I cannot be bothered right now. Just go watch the video. I want to eat lunch. I'm sorry.</li>
