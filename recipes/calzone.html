        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>It's basically pizza but with the form factor shaken up, and it's a great change of pace. Honestly, I couldn't tell you what I put in this calzone, but it was probably pretty good.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><em>Note: I won't be listing any specific amounts because it really is just about feeling. You can use as much or as little of any given topping as you'd like. That probably isn't very helpful, but it's how it be.</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese (a decent handful)</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce (small scoop, can use more garlic olive oil instead)</li>
            <li>Oregano (a pinch)</li>
            <li>Garlic olive oil (a little goes a long way)</li>
            <li>Pecorino romano cheese</li>
            <li>Whatever else you want! I enjoy peppers (roasted red, jalape&ntilde;o), onions, and usually one type of meat in my calzones. They really are just rolled up pizzas, so add whatever sounds good!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>To me, the beauty of pizza is just how free form you can be with the toppings. A lot of people like a more simple pizza, which is completely valid and tasty, but others such as myself prefer something more elaborate with many different toppings working in tandem. Calzones are no different, so just make it how you like it! Here's the process:</p>


        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol class="directions">
            <li>To keep things pretty simple, I'm going to assume you've made your own dough or gotten some from your local pizza joint. Assuming it's fairly balled up, pound out the dough using the tips of your fingers (excluding your thumbs), slowly working your way into the middle. You want the dough to be fairly evenly spread out by the end, but you want to avoid having the inside be too thin in the middle, or your pizza may end up floppy or even just rip. If the dough looks a bit lopsided, you can drag a bit as you pound to try and shape it back into a circle, but generally just work your way around the dough, mirroring the pounding motions with each hand (e.g. if you're going clockwise along the left side with your left hand, go counter clockwise around the other side with your right). Depending on how proofed, or airated, your dough is this can vary wildly in how time consuming it is and how easy it is to get a great circular shape, so practice really does make perfect.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is pounded out fairly well with the inside being as thick as or a bit thicker than the edges, you can lift the dough with the tops of your hands. The next step is to stretch it out, which can easily be done with the following technique: while the dough is lifted, bring your hands up and away from one another, just enough to stretch the dough a little. Then, bring your right hand down and cross it under your left (you should move your left hand to the right a bit to facilitate this), with the dough draping back on that hand. Then, retract your left hand and reset it back to the initial position, with the dough draped over both knuckles. Keep doing this, gradually stretching out the edges, until the dough reaches the desired length.</li>
            <li>Place the dough upon your flat pizza making surface of choice, being sure to throw down some flour before hand to prevent it from sticking. The less experienced you are, the more important it is to have your surface be well lubricated. For a calzone I recommend not trying to keep a perfect circle with your dough, and instead having it be slightly ovular, about 1ft to 10" across.</li>
            <li>Begin by placing a nice little mound of mozzarella slightly off center, on the side closer to you, while making sure to leave a small gap between the cheese and the edge of the dough. We'll be folding the dough over at the end, so the cheese does not need to cover the entire dough, and we need room to connect the ends of the dough once it's folded.</li>
            <li>Place a small amount of sauce on top of your cheese mound, trying to keep it from spilling over onto the dough. If you don't plan on adding any extra toppings, then make sure you add extra mozzarella here because you don't want the sauce to touch the top of the calzone or it upsets the texture and appearance. If not, simply start to stack up your toppings. Once that's done, hit the stack with a pinch of oregano and some pecorino romano cheese.</li>
            <li>Grab the dough on the side you didn't place the toppings on and pull it over until the ends meet, then pound those ends together with the tips of your fingers, making sure you really seal the ends. Take a pizza cutter or some other cutting tool and trim off the lip of dough, leaving only a couple centimeters behind. At this point we'll want to crimp the dough to get that nice braided edge you see in the image. How I do it is I'll start at one end, pin the dough down with my right pointer finger, and use my left hand to pull the dough across and over to create a small loop, repeating all the way around. It can be a bit tricky to get a really good crimp, but it's essentially just an aesthetic factor, so don't worry too much.</li>
            <li>Pour a tiny amount of garlic olive oil on top, just enough to spread with your hand to roughly cover the calzone surface (try not to get too much oil between the dough and the board, because it is prime cause for your calzone sticking). Then, top the calzone with a generous amount of pecorino romano and some oregano. You're almost done, you just want to make a few small slits on the top of your calzone to let the heat escape. Generally I'll just rap it quickly with my pizza cutter a couple times, but you can also use a knife, or just pull open some breathing holes manually.</li>
            <li>Finally, bake your calzone in the oven at 450-600 degrees. Generally more heat is better here, since slow cooking the calzone can result in a bit of a soft exterior. Keep an eye on it, maybe spinning it around once during cooking, and once you reach a lovely golden brown it'll be all good to go. Pull it out and enjoy!</li>
