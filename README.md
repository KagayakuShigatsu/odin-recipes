Odin Recipes Project

The goal is to make a website with some links to different
recipes. Crazy, I know. Skills with basic Git commands and the
command line are being tested as much as rudimentary HTML skills.

In retrospect, I feel like I solidified my understanding of the basic
HTML commands, learned some new VSCode shortcuts, and became more
familiar with using Git from the command line. I also learned a little
about styling text in HTML so that it doesn't look like as much of a
trainwreck, although I didn't dive too deep into it since I assume that
it will be covered in lessons shortly.

I injected a lot of my personality (and my job) into this project, and it
was quite a bit of fun to make.
